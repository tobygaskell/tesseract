# **Rules of FPG**

Every Round of the Premier Leage, each player will pick 1 team they believe are likely to win. Then:

- If your team win you earn a point 
- If that team looses you loose a point 
- If the team draws you neither gain nor loose a point 

The Winner of the game will be the player at the end of the season with the most points. 

SIMPLE. 
However, You are only aloud to pick the same team a maximum of 2 times in the same season. 

## A few more added features to consider 

**Head to Head** 

Depending on the team selections your team could be playing in a "Head to Head" 

This is where the team you picked is playing against a team someone else has picked.

For the players involved in this fixture the points are doubled meaning a win = 2 points and a loss = -2. A draw is still worth 0 points.

**Double Point Weekend** 

Each round will have a 10% change of being a 'Double Point Weekend'. 

This means for that round all the points are doubled. Hence a win = 2 points and a loss = -2 points. A draw is still worth 0 points. 

Double Points Weekends will be determined automatically by python with a 10% chance. 

**Draw Weekend** 

2 random weekends throughout the year will be what we call "Draw Weekends". 

This means for this weekend a draw is now worth 2 points the other two results remain the same points win = 1 and loss = -1.

The draw weekends will be decided at the start of the game and announced at the start of that round. 

**Derbies** 

If the team you picked is playing in a 'Derby' you will earn double points for a win and a loss 

However in derbies a draw = -1 points. Because drawing a derby is boring!!!

The list of derbys will be as follows: 

- Man Utd vs Man City 
- Liverpool vs Everton 
- Arsenal vs Spurs 
- Chelsea vs Fulham 
- Man City vs Liverpool 
- Leeds vs Man Utd
- Sheffield Utd vs Leeds Utd 
- Man Utd vs Liverpool 
- West Bromwich Albion at Aston Villa
- Wolves vs West Brom 
- Wolves vs Aston Villa 


That is the full list of rules! 

To make it more fun we reccomend 6 players putting in £10 each. This allows you to give prize money at the end of the season do this however you see fit but we reccomend 

1) Winner gets £40 
2) Second gets £15 
3) Third  gets £5  

## Happy Playing Everyone!
